# skat-probability
Some probability calculation on the Skat game. Card game related source code was stolen directly from sbking.

## Probability of:

#### Buben split 1/1 between hand 2 and hand 3 GIVEN hand 1 and skat have 2 buben:~0.5256242616106351
Reasoning: Give one Bube to one of hands 2 or 3. Now there are 19 remaining cards to deal: 9 of them will make 2 Buben in the same hand and 10 of them will split them, so split probability equals 10/19 = ~0,526315789
